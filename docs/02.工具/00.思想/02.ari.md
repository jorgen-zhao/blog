There are several approaches that can be used to solve complex and high scale software problems:

1. Modular design: Breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable components that can be developed and tested independently can help simplify the problem and make it easier to solve. Modular design also makes it easier to maintain and update the software in the future.
2. Domain-Driven Design (DDD): DDD is an approach to software design that recognizes the importance of domain knowledge in building software systems. It seeks to address the challenges of building complex software systems by breaking down the system into smaller, manageable components that reflect the key elements of the business domain.
3. Microservices: Microservices is an architecture style that involves building software systems as a collection of small, independent services, each of which focuses on a specific business capability. This architecture style can help simplify complex software systems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable parts.
4. Cloud computing: Cloud computing platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform can provide the resources and infrastructure needed to build and run large scale software systems. These platforms can help reduce the complexity of managing hardware and software resources, and can help ensure that the software system is highly available and scalable.
5. Continuous delivery and deployment: Automating the process of building, testing, and deploying software can help ensure that changes to the software system are delivered quickly and reliably. Continuous delivery and deployment can also help reduce the risk of introducing bugs and other issues into the software system.
6. Monitoring and logging: Monitoring the health and performance of the software system, as well as collecting and analyzing logs and other operational data, can help identify and resolve problems before they become critical. Monitoring and logging can also help identify performance bottlenecks and other issues that can impact the scalability of the software system.
7. Performance optimization: Performance optimization involves identifying and addressing performance bottlenecks in the software system. This can include optimizing database queries, reducing the size and complexity of the software system, and implementing caching and other performance optimization techniques.

In summary, solving complex and high scale software problems requires a combination of good software design practices, the use of appropriate architecture patterns, and the use of tools and techniques that can help ensure that the software system is scalable, available, and performant.
