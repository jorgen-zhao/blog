## stack

FILO 

push peek/ pop

uses of stacks

1. unde/redo features in text editors
2. moving back/forward though brower history
3. backtracking algorithms(maze file directories)
4. calling functions(call stack)

## Queue

FIFO

add enqueue offer / remove dequeue poll

1. keyboard buffer(letters should appear on the screen in the order they’re pressed)
2. printer queue (print jobs should be completed in order)
3. used in LinkedLists, priorityQueues, Breath-first search

### PriorityQueue

a FIFO data structure that serves element with the highest priorities first before elements with lower priority

### Linked List
- Single linked list
- doule linked list

Advantage

- Dynamic data structure (allocates needed memory while running)
- Insertion and deletion of nodes is easyO(1)
- NO/Low memory Waste

Disadvantage

- Greater memory usage(additional pointer)
- No random access of elements (no index [i])
- Accessing searching elements is more time consuming O(n)

uses
